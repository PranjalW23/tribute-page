                    <h3>A visionary writer who delved into the human psyche and existential crises</h3>
                    <p>
                        Franz Kafka (1883 – 1924) was a German-speaking Bohemian novelist and short story writer, 
                        widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic, 
                        often focusing on isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments, incomprehensible bureaucracies, and the absurd.
                        Kafka’s best-known works include "The Metamorphosis," "The Trial," and "The Castle." His stories explore themes such as alienation, guilt, and existential dread.
